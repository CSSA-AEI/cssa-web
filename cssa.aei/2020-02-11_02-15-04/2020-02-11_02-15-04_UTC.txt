Kinaxis presents: Intro to Machine learning

TOMORROW @ 1:00pm at Stem 117

Prereqs:
Basic Python

The workshop is going to tackle successful application of machine learning algorithms on data collected by multiple scientists through the Human Micro-biome Project.

It will address some common pitfalls with real data that you might encounter if you're trying to build a machine learning product, as well as introducing some supervised and unsupervised algorithms applicable on that dataset.

Hands-on exercises included, we'll be sharing a Kaggle kernel with the data attached.
