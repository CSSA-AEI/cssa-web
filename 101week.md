# <center>101 Week 2020</center>

## <center>September 5th - September 12th 2020</center>

### Hey 101ers! Welcome to the Computer Science Student Association family! ðŸ‘‹

#### This yearâ€™s 101 Week will run a little differently than previous years. Usually, 101 Week is conducted in-person, but with the safety guidelines issued by the University and government, it has been decided that a normal 101 Week wonâ€™t be happening. As an alternative, our association has decided to host a virtual 101 week free of charge! While we might have in-person events, information regarding that will be given at a later time.

#### Below you will find a registration form to sign-up for our (Virtual) 101 Week. Participation is optional but we would love to have you!

#### The exec team and guides are super excited to meet you all ðŸ¤©
#### See you soon!
