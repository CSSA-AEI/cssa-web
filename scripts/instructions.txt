if you run into an error and are asked to login run:

`instaloader --login []username] --password [password]`

and if you are asked to authenticate and it does not work at all follow these steps:
1. Install FireFox if you do not have it already
2. Login to your Instagram account in FireFox and make sure you are remembered
3. Open import_firefox_sessions.py and make sure the path to FireFox in whichever machine you are using is correct
4. run `python3 import_firefox_sessions.py`
5. Try logging in again, but without a password `instaloader --login [username]`
