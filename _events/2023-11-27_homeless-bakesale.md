Enjoy tasty treats in support of Youth Homelessness Awareness Month! Visit us on November 27 from 11:00 AM - 4:00 PM, as we are selling baked goods inside Jock Turcot (UCU). All proceeds will go to Restoring Hope, a local charity that provides youth and young adults with physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual support. Join us and help our community and enjoy tasty baked goods!
