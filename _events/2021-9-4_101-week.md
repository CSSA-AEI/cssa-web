Hello first year students!

Congratulations and welcome to the computer science program! Weâ€™re the Computer Science Student Association; a student-led organization that coordinates social and academic events for the computer science students. We also represent the student body in decisions that involve computer science students at the University of Ottawa.

We would like to invite you all to this yearâ€™s 101 Week, taking place September 4-11. 101 Week is a welcome event we host that spans 1 week. It is filled with activities to get to know your new peers and better get to know the campus you will be joining. Basically, it is a week to officially welcome you to uOttawa! Due to the current circumstances, this 101 Week will be hybrid, meaning we will have some virtual events, and some in-person events. <b>If you would like to register, please fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2JkJ-_6gpX_-_xFaL5GTgCIQCQoVPeFtS44rpHTn_eR5kYQ/viewform" target="_blank" class="">form</a></b>.

All students who would like to participate in in-person events <b>MUST</b> buy a 101 Week Kit. Kits sales will take place <b>Saturday September 4 and Sunday September 5 from 10AM to 4PM, in front of the STEM building</b>. Kits are <b>$20 each</b>, and they include a 101-er t-shirt, access to all CSSA and UOSU events for the week, and swag. Kits are in limited supply and are on a first come first serve basis, so make sure to come early to guarantee your spot!

All those who register will receive an email a week before 101 Week with the schedule and all the information you will need for the week.  For any questions concerning 101 Week, please email Eli, our 101 Week coordinator, at [101coordinator@cssa-aei.ca](mailto:101coordinator@cssa-aei.ca). <b>To register for 101 Week, please fill out the form by clicking <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2JkJ-_6gpX_-_xFaL5GTgCIQCQoVPeFtS44rpHTn_eR5kYQ/viewform" target="_blank" class="">here</a></b>.
