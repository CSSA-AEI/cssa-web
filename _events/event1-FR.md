Une occasion d'examiner certaines des recherches que nos professeurs effectuent lorsqu'ils ne nous enseignent pas les structures de données ou le génie logiciel. Les professeurs donnent des exposés de 10 à 20 minutes sur divers points de recherche sur lesquels ils travaillent actuellement!

Cet évènement sera en anglais.

Here are some of the professors speaking and a bit about there talk:

Professor Ksenia Dolgaleva:
Optics is a part of Physics dealing with the description of light propagation through optical media and optical components, and light-matter interaction. Photonics describes how light propagates through, artificial (men-made) structures, and how such structures can be tailored to control the flow of light. This field of research combines Physics and Engineering; its development took of with the invent and progress in the field of nanofabrication.

Professor Jeongwon Park:
Technology has significantly enhanced societal well-being, and innovation in nanotechnology is at the crux of industrial change throughout the world. To fuel the increasing demand for functionality from wearable mobile devices for the “Internet of Things (IoT)”, integrated electronics on flexible hybrid substrates is well recognized as a realistic solution. Wearable sensor technologies are crucial to the realization of personalized medicine through continuously monitoring an individual’s state of health. Wearable devices are now at the heart of just about every discussion related to the Internet of Things (IoT), and the full range of new capabilities pervasive connectivity can bring. This talk presents the present status and possible future developments of nanotechnology in the area of flexible wearable nano-electronics and photonics applications with engineered advanced materials. The physical and technical limitations of these materials are discussed. Engineered advance materials and nanotechnology-enabled high performance devices that have not yet been realized will be discussed.

Professor Lucia Moura and graduate student Thais Idalino:
We will talk about a problem within the area of Combinatorial Cryptography, where we use combinatorial methods to solve problems in cryptography and security. The topic of the talk will be about guaranteeing fault tolerance when aggregating digital signatures, in a more efficient way than it has been prossible before. This is joint work with PhD student Thais Bardini Idalino who will be co-presenting the talk.

Professor Miguel Garzon:
Research project which main goal is to design and implement an efficient methodology for ingest network traffic data at various time intervals, preprocess and integrate all related/ available (Big)-data sources, and generate/ select the most significant attributes (statistical, graph and signature based) for the network traffic classification especially for detecting major types of malicious activities (e.g. DDOS, Beaconing, Scanning, Malware etc.) and also may be expanded to a sub layer for types of malware classification.
