The University of Ottawa is contemplating forcing students to use Respondus Lockdown browser and monitoring during examinations.

This software and others like it use video surveillance through webcams to record students during examinations and detect suspicious behaviours. This can result in privacy concerns, heightened anxiety and technological limitations for students.

<b> We believe that you should be informed in the potential mental health and anxiety/security problems that this may cause, we recommend you check out <a href="https://upetition.ca/" target="_blank" class="">https://upetition.ca/</a> for more information as well as a petition to stop the university from using this software. </b>
